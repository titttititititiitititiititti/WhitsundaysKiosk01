## 🚀 Quick Start (Test First!)

### Step 1: Test Voice System

1. **Restart your Flask app** (if running):
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop if running
python app.py
```

2. **Open the test page** in your browser:
```
http://localhost:5000/voice-test
```

3. **Test the voice**:
   - Click "Click to Speak"
   - Allow microphone access
   - Say something like: "I want to go to Whitehaven Beach"
   - You should see your text appear
   - Click "Test Voice Output" to hear the AI speak

### Step 2: Once Test Works, Integrate into Main Chat

Open `VOICE_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.html` - it has **3 simple copy-paste steps** to add voice to your main chat interface.

## 🎯 How It Works

### For Customers:

```
1. Customer clicks 🎤 "Tap to Speak"
2. Browser asks for microphone permission (once)
3. Customer speaks naturally: "Show me diving tours"
4. Text appears in chat automatically
5. AI responds with text AND voice
```

### Technical Flow:

```
Speech → Web Speech API → Text → Your Chat Function → AI Response → Voice Output
```
