Your Whitsundays Sailing Adventure — What to Expect
Step aboard Hammer, a true race-bred maxi yacht, and launch into a high-energy sailing experience unlike any other. With only 23 guests onboard, every moment is personal, immersive, and exhilarating.

Wake up to a yummy breakfast as you cruise to Tongue Bay. Take a scenic bushwalk to Hill Inlet Lookout for breathtaking views of Whitehaven Beach and the swirling sands of the inlet. Once you have perfected your shots, head down to spend a relaxing 3 hours on Whitehaven beach. Lunch is served back on board before you set sail to your two handpicked snorkel destinations. Once you are snorkelled out (if there is such a thing), head to another one of our favourite beach locations for sunset snacks before heading to your overnight anchorage.
But the fun doesn’t stop there! Enjoy the afternoon in Airlie, head back to your accommodation, freshen up and then join your new friends for an after-party with a reserved table, meal deals, and drink discounts!

Your Whitsundays Sailing Adventure — What to Expect
Embark on the ultimate CONDOR Whitsundays yacht adventure! Our experienced crew will guide you through the breathtaking Whitsunday Islands, ensuring you don’t miss a single highlight.

Wake up to a yummy breakfast as you cruise to Tongue Bay. Take a scenic bushwalk to Hill Inlet Lookout for breathtaking views of Whitehaven Beach and the swirling sands of the inlet. Once you have perfected your shots, head down to spend a relaxing 3 hours on Whitehaven beach. Lunch is served back on board before you set sail to your two handpicked snorkel destinations. Once you are snorkelled out (if there is such a thing), head to another one of our favourite beach locations for sunset snacks before heading to your overnight anchorage.
But the fun doesn’t stop there! Enjoy the afternoon in Airlie, head back to your accommodation, freshen up and then join your new friends for an after-party with a reserved table, meal deals, and drink discounts!

Your Whitsundays Sailing Adventure — What to Expect
Step aboard Hammer, a true race-bred maxi yacht, and launch into a high-energy sailing experience unlike any other. With only 23 guests onboard, every moment is personal, immersive, and exhilarating.
(Please note this is subject to change based on weather conditions and tides)
Wake up to a yummy breakfast as you cruise to Tongue Bay. Take a scenic bushwalk to Hill Inlet Lookout for breathtaking views of Whitehaven Beach and the swirling sands of the inlet. Once you have perfected your shots, head down to spend a relaxing 3 hours on Whitehaven beach. Lunch is served back on board before you set sail to your two handpicked snorkel destinations. Once you are snorkelled out (if there is such a thing), head to another one of our favourite beach locations for sunset snacks before heading to your overnight anchorage.
But the fun doesn’t stop there! Enjoy the afternoon in Airlie, head back to your accommodation, freshen up and then join your new friends for an after-party with a reserved table, meal deals, and drink discounts!

Your Whitsundays Sailing Adventure — What to Expect
Set sail on Broomstick, a high-performance racing yacht turned adventure tour, for 2 unforgettable nights exploring Whitehaven Beach, Hill Inlet, and the best snorkel spots in the Whitsundays.
(Please note this is subject to change based on weather conditions and tides)
Wake up to a yummy breakfast as you cruise to Tongue Bay. Take a scenic bushwalk to Hill Inlet Lookout for breathtaking views of Whitehaven Beach and the swirling sands of the inlet. Once you have perfected your shots, head down to spend a relaxing 3 hours on Whitehaven beach. Lunch is served back on board before you set sail to your two handpicked snorkel destinations. Once you are snorkelled out (if there is such a thing), head to another one of our favourite beach locations for sunset snacks before heading to your overnight anchorage.
But the fun doesn’t stop there! Enjoy the afternoon in Airlie, head back to your accommodation, freshen up and then join your new friends for an after-party with a reserved table, meal deals, and drink discounts!

Your Whitsundays Sailing Adventure — What to Expect
Embark on the ultimate CONDOR Whitsundays yacht adventure! Our experienced crew will guide you through the breathtaking Whitsunday Islands, ensuring you don’t miss a single highlight.
(Please note this is subject to change based on weather conditions and tides)
Wake up to a yummy breakfast as you cruise to Tongue Bay. Take a scenic bushwalk to Hill Inlet Lookout for breathtaking views of Whitehaven Beach and the swirling sands of the inlet. Once you have perfected your shots, head down to spend a relaxing 3 hours on Whitehaven beach. Lunch is served back on board before you set sail to your two handpicked snorkel destinations. Once you are snorkelled out (if there is such a thing), head to another one of our favourite beach locations for sunset snacks before heading to your overnight anchorage.
But the fun doesn’t stop there! Enjoy the afternoon in Airlie, head back to your accommodation, freshen up and then join your new friends for an after-party with a reserved table, meal deals, and drink discounts!
