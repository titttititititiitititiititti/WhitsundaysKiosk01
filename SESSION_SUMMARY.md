## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### **Filter Logic:**
```python
# Duration Filter (FIX-002)
- Check multi-day first (overnight, "2 day", "3 day")
- Parse hour ranges: "2-4 hours" → half day, "6 hours" → full day
- Prevent "2 days" from matching "full day"

# Activity Filter (FIX-003, FIX-004)
- Order: Whitehaven → Reef → Scenic → Island (specific to general)
- Reef requires: reef keywords + water activity keywords
- Prevents: "Crocodile Safari" in reef results
```

### **Image Path Resolution:**
```python
# Smart Keyword Matching (APP-004)
1. Try hash-based ID folder (new format)
2. Try largest image in hash-based folder
3. Try keyword matching against all folders (legacy support)
4. Fallback to placeholder.jpg
```
