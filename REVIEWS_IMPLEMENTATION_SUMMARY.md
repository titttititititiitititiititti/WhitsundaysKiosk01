## 🛠 Customization & Maintenance

### Adding Known TripAdvisor URLs

If the scraper can't auto-find a tour, add the URL manually in `scrape_reviews.py`:

```python
TRIPADVISOR_COMPANY_URLS = {
    'cruisewhitsundays': 'https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g255068-d2427261...',
    'yourcompany': 'YOUR_TRIPADVISOR_URL_HERE',
}
```

### Updating Reviews

**Monthly** (recommended):
```bash
python scrape_reviews.py
```
Skips existing, only scrapes new tours.

**Full Refresh** (every 6 months):
```bash
rmdir /s tour_reviews     # Windows
# or
rm -rf tour_reviews       # Mac/Linux

python scrape_reviews.py
```

### Adjusting Review Count

In `scrape_reviews.py`, change `max_reviews` parameter:
```python
review_data = scrape_tripadvisor_reviews(driver, url, max_reviews=30)  # Get 30 instead of 20
```

## 🔒 Why This Approach?

### ✅ Advantages:

1. **Authentic Reviews**: Real customer feedback from TripAdvisor
2. **No Spam/Fake Reviews**: Can't be abused by kiosk users
3. **Professional Appearance**: Shows you're a legitimate operation
4. **SEO Benefit**: Links back to TripAdvisor
5. **Zero Maintenance**: Once scraped, reviews are static (good for kiosk)
6. **No Database Needed**: Simple JSON file storage
7. **Fast Loading**: Reviews cached locally
8. **Offline Ready**: Works even if TripAdvisor is down

### ❌ Why NOT User-Generated Reviews?

- Tourists are booking, not reviewing tours they've taken
- Risk of fake/spam reviews on unattended kiosk
- Would need moderation system
- Starts with zero reviews (bad first impression)
- Security risk (keeping kiosk in your app)
