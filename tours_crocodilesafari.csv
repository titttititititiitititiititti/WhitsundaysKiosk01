The Whitsunday’s Only Crocodile Tour
See estuarine crocodiles in the Wild in the Whitsundays.
Nowhere else in Queensland can you experience so much in one location.
Whitsunday Crocodile Safari offers guests a unique Australian nature experience in natural habitat.
Explore the unique tropical environment of the Whitsunday coastline as you experience the wildlife and vegetation in the estuaries and wetlands.
The natural attractions of the Whitsunday region do not end at the reef and islands. Local estuaries and wetlands stretch inland from the coast, to Proserpine River.
This habitat is home to many species of native birds, mammals, reptiles and marine animals, including about 150 estuarine crocodiles.
Our unique and well appointed campsite is the base for all of your Safari activities. It is located in a natural setting, right on the bank of the Proserpine River, and is surrounded by melaleuca forest and mangrove habitat.
Undercover tables, seating, toilet facilities, drinking water and refreshments are all available at the campsite.
Our campsite also has local historical significance. It was the site of Proserpine’s river port facility over 100 years ago and was used to transport sugar, freight and passengers to and from waiting steamships and barges which traversed the Queensland coast.
We launch our vessel River Runner everyday and our guests are welcome to watch the action as we lower it by crane into Proserpine River.
Once onboard, your calm water adventure cruise begins. While seated in complete safety and comfort, you can investigate a marine mangrove ecosystem.
Observe estuarine (saltwater) crocodiles in their natural habitat. About 150 “Salties” inhabit Proserpine River and its surrounds.
Other wildlife is abundant in the mangroves and you will be fascinated by some of the characters you meet and their unique behaviours.
Our guides attempt to catch the famous Queensland mudcrab each day and provide guests with an entertaining insight into their features and fascinating lifecycle, before releasing the crabs back into Proserpine River.
Explore Goorganga Plains on a tractor-drawn wagon train and discover the vegetation and wildlife in a freshwater wetland habitat.
Our friendly local guides deliver professional expert commentary during the tour to help you understand more about our nature and our country.
Marvel at the many species of flora and fauna and experience unique Australian habitats including melaleuca forests, pastures, marine mangroves and saltpans which fringe the Proserpine River.
Learn about the history of damper and billy-tea as our guides prepare them fresh for you onsite every day.
Once you know the secrets of the recipes and the tricks of the trade, you can see just how good they taste as you sample some traditional Australian “bush tucker”.
Our guides also prepare your delicious BBQ lunch onsite while you relax in comfort at our covered and well equipped campsite.
