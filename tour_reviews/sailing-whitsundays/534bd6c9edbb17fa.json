      "text": "Sailing Whitsundays (owner)a month agoHi Romi,Thank you for the review, feedback, and photos. Glad to hear you enjoyed the snorkelling and most of your experiences in the Whitsundays! That is a fair point about the sails, and thanks for sharing your concerns. Sometimes the wind conditions at sea aren't conducive to sailing, so the captain has to use the motor to ensure the trip can still run smoothly. Nevertheless, we are happy that your experience was overall a positive one!Warm regards,Sailing Whitsundays",
