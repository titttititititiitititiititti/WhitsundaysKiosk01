Also,I did not distinguish left from right, which seemed to cause some trouble to the staff. I am very sorry. Hope they can see, I loved skydiving and will definitely do it again, all thanks to the wonderful staff here"

The pics would speak for themselves - the thrill, the views, the safety measures!"
