      "text": "Hi Kaszandra,Thank you so much for your review! We love to hear from guests who had a great time on our tour. Sorry you didn't get to see a whale, it is the tail end of the Whitsunday whale season so most of them are probably well on their way back to Antarctica by now. But so glad you got to see a turtle and had an amazing day regardless!Warm regards,Whitsunday Bullet Team",
