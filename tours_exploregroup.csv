Is Explore operating to the reef?
Yes - We operate to Bait Reef on our full day tour
Is it still worth visiting the reef?
Yes - The reef is still very much alive, healthy and definitely worth visiting. Although certain parts of the reef does sustain natural damage during cyclone events there are plenty of healthy areas to snorkel or dive.
What is visibility like?
The visibility out at the reef changes every day dependent on weather conditions.
What can I expect to see?
Both locations are packed with coral, colour and marine life. The fringing inner reef tends to be slightly more colourful due to the nature of the soft coral that grows around these areas. You will find numerous smaller reef-dwelling fish such as parrotfish, angelfish, batfish, damselfish and fusiliers. At the outer reef, you can expect to see a hard coral platform reef with impressive drop offs and our friendly resident giant trevallies, along with countless colourful reef fish. If you're lucky you might even get a visit from a turtle, ray or white tip reef shark while on one of our trips!
Is the reef bleached?
No - We are lucky in the Whitsundays to have healthy reef systems which have not been dramatically affected by coral bleaching. Coral bleaching occurs when higher than average water temperatures cause Zooxanthellae (little creatures that live within the coral) to leave. When this happens, you are left with the skeleton of the coral. Our water temperatures sit between 22-28 degrees celsius all year round, making for ideal coral conditions.
