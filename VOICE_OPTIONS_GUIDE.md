# 🎭 Voice Options Guide - Free & Premium

## 🆓 Option 1: Browser Voices (FREE - Try First!)

### Test Your Available Voices:

**Visit this page:**
```
http://localhost:5000/voice-selector
```

**You'll be able to:**

- ✅ Filter by language, gender, quality
- ✅ Find "Premium", "Enhanced", or "Neural" voices (these sound MUCH better!)

### Best Free Voices to Look For:

**Windows:**
- ⭐ **Microsoft Zira** - Natural female voice
- ⭐ **Microsoft David** - Natural male voice
- ⭐ **Microsoft Mark** - Clear male voice
- ⭐ **Microsoft Eva** (if available) - Enhanced female

**Chrome (online):**

### How to Set a Specific Voice:

Once you find a voice you like on the selector page, update `static/voice-chat.js`:

```javascript
// Around line 180-188, replace this section:
const voices = this.synthesis.getVoices();
const preferredVoice = voices.find(voice => 
  voice.lang.startsWith(this.currentLanguage) || 
  voice.lang.startsWith(langCode.split('-')[0])
);
if (preferredVoice) {
  utterance.voice = preferredVoice;
}

// With this (replace "Microsoft Zira" with your chosen voice name):
const voices = this.synthesis.getVoices();
const preferredVoice = voices.find(voice => 
  voice.name.includes('Zira') ||  // Your preferred voice
  voice.lang.startsWith(this.currentLanguage)
);
if (preferredVoice) {
  utterance.voice = preferredVoice;
}
```

## 🎯 My Recommendations:

### For You Right Now:

**1. First, try the voice selector:**
```
http://localhost:5000/voice-selector
```

Look for voices with these keywords:
- "Enhanced"
- "Premium"  
- "Neural"
- "Natural"
- Names (Zira, Samantha, etc.)

These often sound 5-10x better than the default voices!

### If that's not good enough:

**2. Try ElevenLabs ($5/month)** - Best bang for buck

- Get API key
- I'll integrate it for you (15 minutes)
- Sounds like a real human

**3. Or Google Cloud TTS** - Cheapest at scale
- Almost free for kiosk use ($0.40/month)
- Still sounds great
- Easy to integrate
