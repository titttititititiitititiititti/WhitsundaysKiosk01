# 🎙️ ElevenLabs Integration - Setup Complete!

## ✅ What I've Done:

1. **Created `elevenlabs_tts.py`** - Backend API integration
2. **Added `/api/tts` endpoint** in `app.py` - Flask route for voice synthesis
3. **Updated `voice-chat.js`** - Now uses ElevenLabs with browser fallback

---

## 🔧 Final Setup Steps:

### 1. Add Your API Key to `.env`:

Create or edit the `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
# Add this line to your .env file:
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**To get your API key:**
1. Go to https://elevenlabs.io
2. Sign up or log in
3. Go to Profile → API Keys
4. Copy your API key
5. Paste it in your `.env` file

---

### 2. Install Required Package:

```bash
pip install requests
```

(You probably already have this, but just in case!)

---

### 3. Restart Your Flask App:

Press `Ctrl+C` in your terminal, then:
```bash
python app.py
```

---

## 🎭 Voice Selection:

I've configured **Sarah** as the default voice - she's professional and perfect for tour guidance!

**Other great voices available:**
- **Sarah** (female) - Professional, clear (current default) ⭐
- **Josh** (male) - Friendly, warm
- **Rachel** (female) - Energetic
- **Antoni** (male) - Warm, trustworthy

To change the default voice, edit `elevenlabs_tts.py` line 16-19.

---

## 🌐 Language Support:

ElevenLabs works with ALL your kiosk languages:
- ✅ English
- ✅ Chinese (Simplified)
- ✅ Japanese
- ✅ Korean
- ✅ German
- ✅ French
- ✅ Spanish
- ✅ Hindi

The voice automatically switches based on customer's language selection!

## 🎯 How It Works:

```
Customer speaks → AI responds → ElevenLabs synthesizes → Audio plays
                                       ↓ (if fails)
                               Browser TTS (fallback)
```

**Benefits:**
- ⭐ **Premium quality** - Sounds like a real human
- 🌐 **Multilingual** - Works in all 8 languages
- 🔄 **Auto-fallback** - Uses browser if ElevenLabs fails
- ⚡ **Fast** - ~1-2 second synthesis time
- 🎨 **Natural** - Emotional intonation and expression

---

## 💰 Cost Tracking:

**ElevenLabs Creator Plan:** $5/month
- 30,000 characters/month
- ~300 AI responses
- Perfect for kiosk use

**Your usage:**
- Average response: ~100 characters
- 50 customers/day × 2 responses = 100 responses/day
- 100 × 100 chars = 10,000 chars/day
- ~3 days of usage per $5

---

## 🧪 Testing:

**Test ElevenLabs directly:**
```bash
python elevenlabs_tts.py
```

This will:
1. Check if API key is configured
2. Synthesize a test phrase
3. Save as `test_elevenlabs.mp3`

**Test in browser:**
1. Reload your page: http://localhost:5000
2. Open chat assistant
3. Click 🎤 and speak, or type a message
4. AI response will be spoken with ElevenLabs!
5. Check browser console (F12) - you'll see "🎙️ Using ElevenLabs TTS..."

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting:

### "ElevenLabs not configured" error:
- Make sure `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` is in your `.env` file
- Restart Flask app after adding the key

### "Speech synthesis failed":
- Check your API key is valid
- Check you have credits remaining
- Will automatically fall back to browser TTS

### "Fallback to browser TTS":
- API request failed (network issue?)
- Will use browser voice instead (seamless fallback)

### Check console logs:
- Look for `🎙️ Using ElevenLabs TTS...` (success)
- Or `🔊 Using browser TTS (fallback)...` (fallback)

---

## 🎨 Voice Quality Comparison:

**Browser TTS (before):**
- ⭐⭐⭐ Good quality
- Robotic tone
- Limited emotion
- Free

**ElevenLabs (now):**
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent quality
- Human-like
- Natural intonation
- $5/month

**The difference is HUGE!** Customers will notice immediately.
