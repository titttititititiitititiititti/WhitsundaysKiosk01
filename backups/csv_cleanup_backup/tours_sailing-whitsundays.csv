There's no better place to unwind and watch the sunset after a big day of exploring the Whitsundays with new friends! Once the sun has set, the Atlantic Clipper turns on its night lights to attract all sorts of sea life that you wouldn't get to see during the day, such as squid, dolphins, reef sharks and nocturnal fish.

But the fun doesn't stop there, as being on a speedy racing maxi-yacht such as Defender, your journey between stops will be just as fun as the destinations themselves! Relax and enjoy...
On your Whitsundays voyage, you'll visit the spectacularly beautiful Whitehaven Beach! With the purest white silica sands in the world for as far as the eye can see (7km to be precise), this otherworldly location is the ideal place to spend a few hours frolicking in the sand, spotting epic marine life (such as turtles, juvenile reef sharks and sting rays), taking a snap at the iconic Whitehaven tree and soaking up the abundant rays of the North Queensland sunshine.
Snorkelling the Great Barrier Reef
On British Defender, you'll get lots of time time to fully explore the sensational subaquatic universe that comprise the fringing reefs of the Whitsundays! Your skipper will choose the best locations to visit on the day, meaning you get to experience the finest reefs in their most optimal conditions, and you are guaranteed see some of the most incredible marine life in the area.
From sea turtles to manta rays, humpback whales (June - September) to Maori Wrasse, reef sharks to dolphins, the Whitsunday Islands are home to all of these species, and there's a high chance you'll get to witness some of these while snorkelling here!
Please note, that itineraries can change due to the weather, tides and your captain's professional judgement.

Below the waterline, the Whitsundays offers an array of colourful corals and amazing marine mammals and fish. The waters are a pristine blue and a beautiful temperature year-round. Because of the low passenger numbers, this vessel can get to locations that are more remote and off the beaten track so you're guaranteed a unique experience without the crowds.
