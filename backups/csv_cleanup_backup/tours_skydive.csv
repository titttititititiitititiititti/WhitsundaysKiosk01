Airlie’s home to an African bar with a zebra-striped dance floor. And yes, you need to go. Keep an eye out for whales migrating if you skydive between June and September! Lonely Planet dubbed this the second-best place in Australia. Sorry, Sydney. Skydive Airlie Beach TROPICAL VIBES & TINGLES ALONG YOUR SPINE. NO COMBO QUITE LIKE IT. A roaring bar scene, unfathomable natural beauty and rarely a day below 25 degrees. Oh yes, Airlie Beach delivers on the hype and big promises. Prepare to be sun-soaked and semi-nude every day of your visit, with balmy nights of beach parties thumped in between. It’s a coconut cake of a place and your skydive will be the icing. Get ready to soar over the Whitsundays at almost 200km/hr, admiring Hayman and Hamilton Island on the descent.
