Tour Details
Leaving Tongue Point, you will cruise across Whitehaven Bay to visit the famous Whitehaven Beach. Any tour of the Whitsundays wouldn't be complete without taking a dip in the beautiful clear waters or just relaxing on the powder-white silica sand on Whitehaven Beach. With up to 2 hours at Whitehaven Beach, you can enjoy a leisurely stroll along the beach, basking in the water, or walking up to the lookout.
The tour departs from Whitehaven Beach as you cruise back through the Whitsunday Islands, completing the circumnavigation of Whitsunday Island and returning to Shute Harbour at approximately 5:00pm.
This tour runs daily (excluding Christmas Day) and includes a complimentary bus pick-up and drop-off service from multiple transfer points. Enjoy morning tea, lunch, and afternoon tea with the convenience of an onboard bar to purchase beverages throughout the duration of the tour.
