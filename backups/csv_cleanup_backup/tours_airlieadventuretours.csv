top of page Cedar Creek Express Tour from Airlie Beach (Whitsundays) ​ If you’re looking for unforgettable things to do in Airlie Beach that are easy, scenic, and genuinely refreshing, Cedar Creek Express is the perfect half-day nature escape. This relaxed, eco-certified tour whisks you from Airlie Beach (Whitsundays, Queensland) into the lush hinterland to Cedar Creek Falls—a rainforest waterhole and waterfall set in a natural rock amphitheatre, surrounded by tropical greenery and birdlife. ​ In just a few hours, you’ll swap salty air and beach crowds for cool freshwater, rainforest shade, and that “wow, I can’t believe this is so close to town” feeling. Cedar Creek Falls sits roughly halfway between Airlie Beach and Proserpine on Saltwater Creek Road, making it one of the Whitsundays’ easiest and most rewarding nature experiences. ​ Why Cedar Creek Falls is such a lovely spot ​ Cedar Creek Falls is beloved for one simple reason: it’s a true rainforest oasis. Step through the trees, and you’ll find a clear rock pool tucked beneath a cliff line—an amphitheatre of stone where the waterfall spills down when conditions are right. ​ Even when the main cascade is gentle, the place still delivers: cool water, palms and vines, and that peaceful soundtrack of birds, rustling leaves, and running creek water. It’s a “reset button” kind of location—perfect for couples, families, solo travellers, and anyone who wants a nature break without committing to a full-day hike. ​ Cancel up to 24 hours before departure time for a full refund. ​ A little history and “deep time” of the landscape ​ Cedar Creek Falls sits at the edge of the Conway Range / Cape Conway peninsula, part of an area that protects the largest remaining lowland tropical rainforest in Queensland outside Tropical North Queensland. What makes this landscape special isn’t just how green it is—it’s how long it has endured. Queensland Parks notes that the rainforest here has persisted through climate fluctuations over tens of thousands of years, acting as a refuge for wildlife. And if you’ve spent any time on the Whitsunday islands, here’s a fun connection: the vegetation you’ll see around the Conway area is similar to what’s on the islands because rising sea levels thousands of years ago flooded coastal valleys and created the Whitsunday islands. In other words, this rainforest-to-reef region has been shaping itself for a very long time, and Cedar Creek is a beautiful little window into that story. ​ Respect for Country ​ This area is part of Country cared for by the Gia and Ngaro Peoples, with Queensland Parks recognising the deep cultural connection and responsibility Traditional Owners maintain for the Conway Range and surrounding places. ​ What you’ll do on Cedar Creek Express ​ Scenic transfer from Airlie Beach to the falls ​ Relax in air-conditioned comfort as we head out of Airlie Beach and into the green hinterland. Cedar Creek Falls is located between Airlie Beach and Proserpine, so you’re never far from town—yet it feels a world away once you arrive. ​ Guided rainforest time (easy and relaxed) ​ This is not a “march through the bush” tour. It’s a short, easy nature experience with a local guide who shares the little details most visitors miss—why certain plants thrive here, what wildlife to watch for, and how the seasons change the falls. ​ Swim time in the freshwater waterhole ​ Bring your swimmers and towel—this is the moment everyone talks about. The pool is the perfect place to cool down, float, relax on the rocks, or simply sit in the shade and take it all in. ​ Wildlife spotting and photo time ​ Depending on the day, you might see: Colourful butterflies and rainforest insects Birds flitting through the canopy Turtles, fish, and other creek life near the water’s edge ​ Cedar Creek Falls is known for its surrounding tropical flora—white cedar trees, Alexandra palms, wild orchids, and more—so there’s plenty to notice even if you’re not trying to “tick off” wildlife. ​ Morning or afternoon tea ​ A simple, relaxed break that fits the vibe—no rushing, no fuss, just a good snack and a moment to enjoy the rainforest. ​ Why this tour is special (and why guests love it) ​ Eco-certified touring with a nature-first focus (small footprint, big experience) Short and sweet: ideal if you want something amazing without giving up your whole day Fully guided: you’ll get more than just a swim—you’ll understand the place A true Whitsundays local favourite: rainforest freshwater close to Airlie Beach ​ When is Cedar Creek Falls “at its best”? ​ Cedar Creek Falls is famously seasonal. It’s often most spectacular in the wet season or after decent rain, when the waterfall really comes alive. In the drier months, the main cascade may be lighter—but the waterhole remains a gorgeous place to swim and unwind, and the rainforest setting is still worth the trip (especially on a hot Whitsundays day). ​ What’s included Your seat on our air-conditioned minibus Morning or afternoon tea Water bottle refills Travel snacks ​ What to bring Refillable water bottle Towel + swimmers Camera/phone for photos Your sense of fun and adventure Optional but handy: Reef/water shoes (rocks can be slippery) Light rain jacket in the wet season ​ Safety & care for the environment ​ We keep things relaxed, but we also take safety seriously—especially around natural water. A few simple rules help keep everyone safe: Never dive or jump into natural waterways (depth and submerged hazards can change). Supervise children closely near water and follow your guide’s instructions. In North and Central Queensland, it’s smart to stay CrocWise around waterways: keep a sensible distance from the water’s edge, avoid approaching the water unnecessarily, and always follow signs/advice. ​ We also love this place—so we travel gently. Please take all rubbish with you and respect the rainforest so it stays beautiful for future visitors (and the locals who cherish it). ​ Perfect for… Visitors searching “things to do in Airlie Beach” beyond the lagoon and main street Families who want a safe, guided nature outing Couples wanting a scenic, refreshing Whitsundays half-day adventure Anyone keen for a freshwater swim away from beach crowds ​ Ready to book your Cedar Creek escape? ​ If your Whitsundays itinerary needs one easy, beautiful nature moment—this is it. Cedar Creek Express delivers rainforest air, cool, fresh water, and a local-guided experience that feels like a hidden gem (because it kind of is). bottom of page

top of page Eungella Wild Platypus Encounter – Eco-Certified Day Tour from Airlie Beach (Whitsundays) ​ Swap salty sea air for cool mountain mist on the Eungella Wild Platypus Encounter, an eco-certified day tour from Airlie Beach (Whitsundays) into the lush rainforest of Eungella National Park in Queensland’s Mackay Highlands. If you’re searching for things to do in Airlie Beach that go beyond island cruises and beach days, this is one of the most rewarding mainland adventures in the region—scenic lookouts, rainforest boardwalks, and the chance to spot a wild platypus in its natural habitat. ​ The Eungella Wild Platypus Encounter is built for travellers who want a real wildlife experience: no enclosures, no feeding, no staged moments—just patient, respectful viewing in one of Australia’s best-known platypus locations. You’ll travel in comfort with a friendly local guide who knows the roads, the rainforest, and the best ways to help you “read” the water. ​ Why choose this day tour from Airlie Beach? ​ The Whitsundays are famous for sailing and Whitehaven Beach, but on the Eungella Wild Platypus Encounter, you’ll experience a completely different side of Queensland—ancient rainforest, clear creeks, cooler mountain air, and the excitement of wildlife spotting in the wild. ​ The journey on the Eungella Wild Platypus Encounter is part of the magic. As you leave the coast behind, the landscape shifts from tropical shoreline to open farmland and mountain foothills, then climbs into the greener, mistier ranges. Along the way, your guide shares local stories, ecosystem insights, and practical tips that turn “nice scenery” into a richer experience. Cancel up to 24 hours before departure time for a full refund. The highlight: Broken River platypus spotting ​ At the heart of the day is the famous Broken River region—widely regarded as one of the best places in Australia to try and see platypus in the wild. Here, the Eungella Wild Platypus Encounter slows down for calm, quiet observation at proven habitat zones, giving you the best possible opportunity to spot a platypus surfacing, feeding, or gliding through still water. ​ During the Eungella Wild Platypus Encounter, your guide will show you what to look for—because platypus sightings are often subtle. Watch for quick surface glides and gentle “V” wakes, small ripples that don’t match the current, bubbles rising near undercut banks, and faint movement patterns as they forage. ​ Rainforest scenery, lookouts, and easy walks ​ Beyond wildlife viewing, the Eungella Wild Platypus Encounter is a refreshing rainforest escape into the “Land of the Clouds.” You’ll breathe in crisp, cool air, enjoy lush green forest, and take in scenic lookouts that showcase the beauty of the Eungella ranges. Short, easy walks and boardwalk sections keep the experience accessible while still feeling immersive. ​ Lunch included at the Pinnacle Pub ​ A full-day adventure needs a proper refuel. The Eungella Wild Platypus Encounter includes lunch at the Pinnacle Pub, where you can enjoy one of their famous pies, stretch your legs, and recharge before continuing into the cooler rainforest country. It’s a relaxed, local stop that adds a classic Queensland flavour to the day. ​ Eco-certified, nature-first touring ​ As an eco-certified operator, the Eungella Wild Platypus Encounter is delivered with low-impact practices and a “leave no trace” mindset. We keep noise low, stay on designated paths and boardwalks, and observe wildlife from a respectful distance—because the best encounters happen when animals can behave naturally. ​ Your day at a glance Start your morning with a smooth pickup and settle in for the Eungella Wild Platypus Encounter from the Whitsundays region. Enjoy a scenic inland drive with local commentary and relaxed pacing. Stop for lunch at the Pinnacle Pub (included), then continue into the cooler rainforest country. Arrive in the ranges, soak up rainforest air, and enjoy gentle walks and lookouts. Spend prime time at Broken River with guided spotting tips and quiet observation. ​ Who this tour is best for ​ The Eungella Wild Platypus Encounter is ideal for nature lovers, photographers, couples, families, and travellers who want a genuine wildlife day trip from Airlie Beach. If you love calm moments in nature, learning local stories, and chasing an iconic Australian animal in the wild, this is for you. ​ Good to know ​ Platypus are wild animals and sightings can’t be guaranteed. However, the Eungella Wild Platypus Encounter targets known habitat, smart timing, and proven viewing locations to maximise your chances while keeping the experience calm and respectful. Weather in the ranges can change quickly, so bring a light layer and a rain jacket. ​ What to bring ​ For a comfortable day on the Eungella Wild Platypus Encounter, we recommend comfortable walking shoes, a refillable water bottle, sunscreen, insect repellent, a light rain jacket, and a camera or phone (a zoom lens helps). The ranges can be cooler than Airlie Beach, so a warm layer is a good idea. ​ Book your Eungella adventure ​ If you’re planning a Whitsundays holiday and want one unforgettable inland experience, book the Eungella Wild Platypus Encounter from Airlie Beach—rainforest scenery, relaxed pacing, local guiding, the thrill of wild platypus spotting at Broken River, and lunch included at the Pinnacle Pub. Escape the coast, explore the highlands, and discover Queensland’s wild side. bottom of page

top of page Airlie Adventure Tours – Beautiful Bowen Beaches Day Tour (from Airlie Beach / Whitsundays) ​ If you’re staying in Airlie Beach and chasing an easy, scenic day out that goes beyond the islands, our Beautiful Bowen Beaches Day Tour is the perfect Whitsunday Coast escape. This relaxed Whitsundays day trip to Bowen blends the very best of Tropical North Queensland coastline with genuine local flavour—iconic beaches, fresh seafood at Bird’s Fish Bar, fascinating WWII Catalina history, and a golden-hour finish at Flagstaff Hill Lookout with bubbles and nibbles as the ocean sparkles below. From the first lookout to the last golden-hour stop, Beautiful Bowen Beaches are the hero of this day. Bowen is one of those places that surprises people. It’s close enough for a comfortable road trip from the Whitsundays, yet it feels like a whole new world—wide bays, turquoise water, rocky headlands, and viewpoints that make you stop in your tracks. With Airlie Adventure Tours, you don’t have to plan routes, find parking, or guess which beaches are worth it. We take you to the highlights, at a comfortable pace, with plenty of time for photos, beach walks, and relaxed local stops. It’s a day that feels like a holiday within your holiday, and it’s built around Beautiful Bowen Beaches from start to finish. ​ A day built around the best of Bowen ​ This tour is designed for travellers who want a mix of coastline, culture, and local food—without being rushed. You’ll enjoy comfortable transport, friendly guiding, and a flowing itinerary that gives you the “wow” moments Bowen is known for, while still leaving room to breathe. Think: photo-worthy beaches, a classic Queensland landmark, a seafood stop that tastes like the sea breeze, and a sunset-style finale you’ll be talking about long after you’re back in Airlie. We plan the route around tides and conditions so you see Beautiful Bowen Beaches at their best. Cancel up to 24 hours before departure time for a full refund. Stop 1: The Big Mango – Bowen’s iconic photo moment ​ No Bowen day trip is complete without a stop at the Big Mango—Bowen’s famous roadside landmark and the perfect “we made it!” photo. It’s fun, it’s classic Australia, and it sets the tone for the day: easy-going, a little bit cheeky, and full of memorable moments. Your guide will share a few local stories as you stretch your legs and snap the kind of holiday photos you’ll actually want to keep. The Big Mango isn’t just a quick stop—it’s part of Bowen’s identity. It’s a celebration of the region’s tropical produce and that proud small-town Queensland spirit. You’ll have time for photos, a laugh, and a quick breather before we head to the coastline—where Beautiful Bowen Beaches start showing off almost immediately. ​ Stop 2: Beautiful Bowen Beaches – bays, headlands and crystal-clear water ​ Then it’s on to the main event: Beautiful Bowen Beaches. Bowen is famous for its bays and lookout points, where the water shifts between glassy turquoise and deep ocean blues depending on the light. This part of the day is all about soaking up that coastal magic—walking along the sand, feeling the sea breeze, and taking your time to enjoy the scenery. We structure the beach stops around the best conditions for the day, so you can experience Bowen at its best. Expect a mix of: Relaxed beach time for a walk, a paddle, or simply sitting back and taking it all in Rocky headlands and viewpoints where you can see the coastline stretching away in both directions Unreal photo opportunities—the kind that make people ask, “Where is this?” ​ If you’d like a swim, bring your swimsuit and a towel. When conditions are right, Bowen’s calm bays can be perfect for a refreshing dip, and it’s a great way to cool off in the tropical heat. We’ll point out the best spots for a safe swim and those “don’t-miss” angles that make Beautiful Bowen Beaches look straight out of a travel magazine. ​ This is also where your guide brings the area to life—pointing out local features, sharing interesting regional tidbits, and helping you capture those “postcard” angles without having to guess where to stand. Between swims, walks and photo stops, you’ll quickly understand why Beautiful Bowen Beaches are a favourite with locals. And because we visit more than one stop, you’ll get a real feel for how different Beautiful Bowen Beaches can be—from calm bays to headland views. ​ Stop 3: Bird’s Fish Bar – Fisherman’s Wharf seafood (with prawns on us) ​ After beach time, appetite levels are usually high—and that’s where Bowen delivers. We head to Bird’s Fish Bar at Fisherman’s Wharf, a local favourite known for classic, no-fuss seafood that tastes even better by the water. This is the heart of Bowen’s working waterfront vibe: salty air, boats nearby, and that feeling you’re exactly where you should be for lunch. ​ You’ll have the chance to purchase your own lunch (think fish and chips, seafood options, and local favourites), and the prawns are on us—a little Airlie Adventure Tours touch that makes the day feel extra special. It’s the kind of lunch stop guests remember because it’s genuine, local, and delicious—no pretence, just good seafood in the right place. Lunch tastes even better when you’ve spent the morning exploring Beautiful Bowen Beaches. ​ And if you’re the type who likes a little browse, Fisherman’s Wharf is also a great spot to take a short walk, stretch your legs, and enjoy the coastal atmosphere before we continue. It’s also a great reset before we head back out to more Beautiful Bowen Beaches viewpoints and coastal scenery. ​ Stop 4: The Catalina Display – Bowen’s WWII flying boat story ​ Bowen’s beauty is only half the story. This town has a fascinating history too—especially its connection to WWII and the Catalina flying boats. During the war, Bowen played a role in Australia’s coastal defence and long-range operations, with Catalina aircraft operating in the region. Today, that story is remembered along the foreshore through local interpretation and a Catalina display/memorial area that helps bring the past to life. ​ On this stop, your guide will share the “why it mattered” side of the story—how flying boats operated, why Bowen’s location was significant, and what life could have looked like here during wartime. It’s a surprisingly powerful part of the day because it connects this peaceful beach town to a much bigger chapter in Australia’s history—right alongside the calm waters and headlands you’ve been enjoying at Beautiful Bowen Beaches. ​ Even if you’re not a history buff, the Catalina stop adds real depth to the tour. It’s a reminder that the Whitsunday Coast isn’t just beautiful—it’s layered with stories that shaped the region. ​ Stop 5: Flagstaff Hill Lookout – golden-hour views with bubbles and nibbles ​ We finish the day on a high—literally—at Flagstaff Hill Lookout, one of Bowen’s most breathtaking viewpoints. The panorama from up here is the kind of scene that makes everyone go quiet for a moment. You’ll look out across Bowen’s bays and coastline as the afternoon light softens, giving the water that sparkling Whitsunday glow. Flagstaff Hill is the perfect finale—one last panoramic moment over Beautiful Bowen Beaches and the Whitsunday coastline. From this vantage point, you can often trace the curves of Beautiful Bowen Beaches and really appreciate just how stunning the coastline is. ​ This is where we turn the view into an experience: A glass of Yellowglen bubbles Cheese, berries and nibbles Time to relax, take photos, and soak up the moment ​ It’s not rushed. It’s not a “jump out, snap a pic, jump back in” stop. Flagstaff Hill is the finale—a calm, scenic, celebratory end to a day of beaches, seafood, and storytelling. ​ Why guests love the Beautiful Bowen Beaches Day Tour ​ Guests consistently love this tour because it offers the ideal balance of easy logistics and high wow factor.

top of page Kangaroos on the Beach at Sunrise — Eco-Certified Cape Hillsborough Tour from Airlie Beach (Whitsundays) ​ If you’re searching for a truly iconic, pinch-me Australian moment, kangaroos on the beach at sunrise is the one. This eco-certified dawn tour departs from Airlie Beach / the Whitsundays, Queensland and takes you to the legendary coastline of Cape Hillsborough National Park, where the day begins in soft pastel light and the shoreline comes alive with wildlife. There are plenty of great things to do in Airlie Beach—but kangaroos on the beach at sunrise is the kind of experience people talk about for years. As the first light spills across the sand, you’ll have the chance to witness wild kangaroos and wallabies emerging from the grassy edges and moving onto the beach. It’s quiet, natural, and unforgettable—one of Queensland’s most photographed sunrise scenes, and for good reason. ​ Why Cape Hillsborough is so special ​ Cape Hillsborough National Park is famous for its rugged headlands, calm bays, and sweeping views across the Coral Sea. But what makes it bucket-list famous is the rare chance to see kangaroos on the beach at sunrise in a setting that still feels wild and untouched. The combination of coastal forest, open sand, and early-morning calm creates ideal conditions for animals to move down to the shoreline. ​ This isn’t a zoo, a staged show, or a fenced encounter. Kangaroos on the beach at sunrise happen in nature, on nature’s schedule—making the moment feel even more real. Your guide will help you understand the area, point out wildlife signs, and share local knowledge so you get more than just a photo—you get the story behind the place. ​ ​ Cancel up to 24 hours before departure time for a full refund. What the morning feels like ​ Your adventure begins pre-dawn with a comfortable pickup in Airlie Beach and surrounding areas. With your seat on an air-conditioned minibus, you can relax on the drive, watch the sky begin to change colour, and feel the anticipation build. The goal is simple: arrive in time for kangaroos on the beach at sunrise, when the light is at its most magical and the beach is at its quietest. When you reach Cape Hillsborough, you’ll step into cool morning air and the gentle sound of waves. Your guide will lead you to the best viewing areas and help you move calmly and respectfully so the animals remain comfortable. This is where kangaroos on the beach at sunrise becomes more than a phrase—it becomes a full-sensory experience: the glow on the horizon, the silhouettes on the sand, the stillness that makes every movement feel special. You’ll have time to take photos, soak it in, and simply be present. Some guests love capturing wide scenic shots, while others prefer close-in moments (always from a respectful distance). Either way, kangaroos on the beach at sunrise offer a rare kind of beauty—natural, unhurried, and deeply “Australian.” ​ A hot breakfast, made even better by the sunrise ​ After the wildlife viewing, it’s time to warm up and refuel. A hot breakfast is provided, and it tastes even better after an early start. Whether you’re a coffee-first person, a hungry adventurer, or travelling with kids who need a morning boost, the breakfast inclusion makes the whole experience feel easy and complete. It’s one thing to tick off kangaroos on the beach at sunrise; it’s another to follow it with a satisfying, hearty meal while you relive the best moments and scroll through your photos. The pace stays relaxed—no rushing, no pressure—just a comfortable, well-planned morning that balances adventure with enjoyment. ​ Eco-certified and wildlife-respectful ​ This tour is designed to deliver kangaroos on the beach at sunrise in a way that is calm, respectful, and aligned with eco-certified principles. Wildlife encounters are most meaningful when animals can behave naturally, without being chased, crowded, or disturbed. Your guide will share simple viewing guidelines—like moving slowly, staying quiet, and giving animals space—so everyone gets a better experience, including the wildlife. Choosing an eco-certified tour also means you’re supporting responsible tourism in the Whitsundays region. Kangaroos on the beach at sunrise is a privilege, and our approach is built around protecting that privilege—so future travellers can experience it too. ​ Wildlife and weather: the real, honest version ​ Because this is a wild environment, sightings can vary. Kangaroos and wallabies are not guaranteed every single day, and sunrise conditions change with weather, cloud cover, and seasonal patterns. That said, many guests find that the unpredictability is part of the magic: every morning looks different, and every visit to kangaroos on the beach at sunrise feels uniquely your own. Your guide will do everything possible to maximise your chances—timing, locations, and local know-how make a big difference—while keeping the experience respectful. And even on mornings when wildlife keeps its distance, Cape Hillsborough is still a stunning coastal national park with dramatic headlands, beaches, and a sunrise that can stop you in your tracks. Kangaroos on the beach at sunrise is the headline, but the whole setting is the reason people fall in love with it. ​ What’s included ​ Everything is set up to make your morning simple and comfortable, so you can focus on the experience. Hotel pickup and drop-off (selected areas) Your seat on our air-conditioned minibus Entry to the national park A hot breakfast is provided (included) Water bottle refills It’s an easy, all-in-one way to experience kangaroos on the beach at sunrise without needing to plan a car, navigate in the dark, or guess the best spots. ​ What to bring ​ To make the most of your morning, we recommend bringing: A refillable water bottle A light rain jacket (especially in the wet season) Swimmers and a towel (if you’d like a quick dip and conditions allow) Personal insect repellent A camera or phone for photos Your sense of fun and adventure ​ A little preparation goes a long way when you’re heading out for kangaroos on the beach at sunrise, especially in the cooler early-morning air. ​ Who this tour is perfect for ​ This experience suits a wide range of travellers: couples chasing an iconic moment, families looking for an easy wildlife adventure, solo travellers who want a safe and social tour option, and photographers seeking that dreamy dawn light. If your wish list includes “wildlife,” “national parks,” and “something uniquely Australian,” kangaroos on the beach at sunrise belongs at the top. It’s also ideal if you’re visiting the Whitsundays and want something beyond the islands—something grounded, local, and deeply connected to Queensland’s natural landscape. bottom of page
