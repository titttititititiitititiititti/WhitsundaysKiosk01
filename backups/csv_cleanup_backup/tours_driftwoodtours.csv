La recogida puntual y muy temprana, a las 03:00 am en tu hotel y a las 10:30 am estás de vuelta. Llegas aún siendo de noche, esperas que amanezca para ver cómo se alimentan los canguros, van a la orilla e incluso algunos luchan entre ellos. Luego subes a un mirador para ver la playa (unos 15 minutos andando) y finalmente desayunas antes de volver a Airlie Beach! Hide Posted on Tripadvisor Aylen D 9 January 2026 Verified Beautiful experience in the creek and finding hidden inland gems of the Whitsundays We went on the Conway nationalPark bushwalk and cedar creek falls tour and wow!

You could ask her anything, and she was so joyful and kind! Posted on Trustindex Kevin M 11 November 2025 Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Trustindex. A truly memorable experience in the Aussie bush I did the waterfalls and bushwalk eco adventure. Our guide, Cherene, was very knowledgeable and attentive. We learnt all about the wildlife and plant life. Lots of snacks and water provided. The waterfall was beautiful, spent some time swimming on the rock pool. Overall, a great tour, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Thank you Cherene. Posted on Tripadvisor Adria E 19 January 2026 Verified Nice day of sightseeing! Had a lovey day exploring the Bowen Beach area with Cherene. She is extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic. She took good care of us on a very hot day. We saw some beautiful scenery, learned some history and had a delicious fish and chips lunch. She's a lovely person to spend the day with. Hide Posted on Tripadvisor Frances C 9 January 2026 Verified Rainforest walk and water falls I would highly recommend this activity to anyone. The waterfalls were flowing when we went. It was so cool and refreshing. It was a quick drive over. First we took a short looped trail, where we went through a rainforest. It was lovely to spot all the flora and fauna, and growing fungi. Afterwards we had some snacks and went to the falls, which were happily flowing. All swimming levels welcomed. Cherene made us all feel comfortable, was very knowledgeable and came prepared. I think that everyone should experience the falls while visiting Airlie ! Thank you Cherene Hide Posted on Tripadvisor Joe D 3 January 2026 Verified Ceder Creek Falls Spent the day at Conway National Park walking through the lush rainforest then onto Cedar creek falls for a dip in the water. Hide Posted on Google MP Frost 13 December 2025 Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google. +0 Cherene was one of the best tour guides we have had in all our trips. She was very knowledgeable and inventive in the locations she brought us to on our tour. She was thoughtful of the heat and accommodating to our late arrival. It was such an excellent experience that we would love to go on another tour with her! To add - a pleasant surprise we learned was she worked at a summer camp in our home town half the world away for 15 years. Posted on Google Sophie Lem 4 December 2025 Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google. +4 The tour was exceptional, and Cherene proved to be an outstanding guide, demonstrating extensive knowledge. We explored numerous beaches and inland viewpoints, with Cherene providing insightful information at each stop. Furthermore, her skills as a photographer were remarkable, as she consistently went above and beyond to capture the most beautiful photos. Posted on Google Magdalena Galek 24 November 2025 Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google. Very knowledgeable guide, great snacks! Fun tour, small group. Good amount of walking, great time swimming! Recommend even if the waterfall doesn’t flow. Posted on Google David Williams 7 November 2025 Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google. Absolutely fabulous! We were able to experience a very informative and interesting tour of Arlie Beach in comfort. David and Anny Posted on Tripadvisor Kathy B 18 January 2026 Verified Great tour, Cherene was fabulous Very well-organized tour that made great use of the time. We saw many excellent sites and were taken to some great photo spots. Our guide, Cherene, was knowledgeable and informative, adding helpful context throughout. Everything ran smoothly with a comfortable pace. A solid choice for seeing a lot and learning along the way. It was timed well for a cruise ship stop.
